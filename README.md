I made this simple python script for myself for use with my partner's [retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/). All it does is remove anything in parenthesis or brackets from the files in the directory in which it's run.

So, `Dr. Mario (Japan, USA) (Rev A).nes` is automagically renamed to `Dr. Mario.nes`. Nice and clean when you're choosing which game to play :)
